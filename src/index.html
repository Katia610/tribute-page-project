          Madagascar where he shared the life of the poor farmers
        </li>
        <li>
          1989: Invited to Anatananarivo to become Head of the Saint
          Vincent-de-Paul Theological college. This same year that he discovered the garbage dump of the town. There he found thousands of children and parents living on a mountain of
          trash who were fighting for food among dogs and pigs. At this moment,
          when he faced this apocalyptic scene of human degradation in extreme
          poverty, he thought “here we mustn’t speak, we must act”. He talked to these people and
          visited them every day for six months before he managed to convince
          70 families to quit the garbage dump in order to create a new village
          on a land located 60 km from the town, given by the authorities

          friend' in Malagasy) which aims to give back a human dignity to
          families that extreme poverty has forced to live in inhuman
          conditions. Father Pedro is convinced that this dignity could be find
          again if there is a structure and a human and spiritual environment
          which could help people to rebuild themselves. That is to say:
          housing, schools and employment. Families and Father Pedro built
          together houses and the first classrooms and set up rules of life in
          this newly created community
